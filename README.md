# OAES-Question-Bank

Implementing 3 use-cases for the Online Assessment & Evaluation System (OAES) and demonstrating it using the layered &amp; microservices architectures.

The use-cases implemented here include,
- Item Author should be able to login and view their added Items.
- Item Author should be able to add new Items.
- Item Author should be able to update added Items.

Design Patterns were used in the initial phase of development and as development shifted towards web-apps, it was observed that the patterns got abstracted under the 
MVC architecture of web-apps which was a learning outcome.

Tech Stack for Layered Architecture (main branch): Java, Jersey REST Framework, Hibernate, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Tech Stack for Microservices Architecture (microservice branch): Java, SpringBoot, Eureka, Spring Cloud Gateway, MySQL, React, JavaScript

This project was made as part of the CS 871 Software Architecture Course @ IIITB
